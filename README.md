# Object_Detection_Algorithm

Algorithm to detect a ball using the OpenCV Library in Python. Project was built for the SE 101 project (repository found [here](https://github.com/Pop0097/Object_Detection_Algorithm). 

This code was first created to work with a desktop camera to ensure the algorithm was functional. Afterwards, the program was optimized and adapted to work with a Raspberry Pi and its associated camera module.
